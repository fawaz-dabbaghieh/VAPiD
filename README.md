# ClinSeq
Automatic Annotation and deposition of UW Virology clinical sequencing data

This program should actually work for most viruses, if you feed it a gff file with annotations, it'll look up the exact viral species
and then package the whole thing up neatly for depositing to genbank 

Installation should be very straight forward, just clone repository and change locataion of blast db

I'll add a help dialouge for the command line eventually but for now this is pretty good

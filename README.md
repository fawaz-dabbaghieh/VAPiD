# ClinSeq
Automatic Annotation and deposition of UW Virology clinical sequencing data
This repository contains scripts for analysis of assembled fasta files of known human viruses. This program annotates these viruses and then packages them up for NCBI deposition. All you need to get going on this is a computer and some fasta files of human viruses. Feed this program the viruses and .sqn files that you can just email to NCBI will be generated!
I can be contacted at uwvirongs@gmail.com for bug reports or feature requests - you can also make them here on github if you like.

The only information you need to supply is a fasta with as many viruses as you'd like to annotate in it as well as an optional metadata sheet and a .sbt file for author lists in the .sqn and .gbf files that NCBI likes. 

# Installation
Installation differs greatly for Unix systems and for Windows

**Mac or Linux**

1. Install all dependencies (Shoutout to the wonderful people who wrote these!)

Python - tested almost exclusively on 2.7.4 but there's nothing in here that shouldn't work on later versions.

If you're running a lower version of python follow this guide to install pip (You may need administrator pillages)
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ 

Download the get-pip.py and run it from the command line by typing `pthon get-pip.py`

Then open a command line and type

`pip install numpy`

`pip install biopython`

Then you'll need to install tbl2asn and put it on your path. (Another option is to download the appropriate version and simply unpack it directly into this repository once you've downloaded it. 
tbl2asn can be found at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/tbl2asn2/

**Windows**

1. Install Microsoft Visual C++ for Python 2.7 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266
2. Install Python 2.7.4 https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.4/ (Although 2.7.5 works as well)
  Make sure that when this is installing on the third step 'Customize your python installation' the box that says put python on your path is checked. This makes installing and running this annotator much easier. 

3. Install Numpy and Biopython - if python is installed correctly this can be done easily by opening a command prompt window and typing:

`pip install numpy`

`pip install biopython`

4. Then download and unzip this repository to your computer (anywhere will do)

5. Download tbl2asn for windows https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/tbl2asn2/  and unzip it, then copy and paste every single file in the tbl2asn folder (there should be like 7 .dlls and an .exe that is simply called tbl2asn 

**After the above has completed there's still a bit of setup that needs to be done.** 

1. A template .sbt file that contains your name and information about the organization that you wish to submit your sequences to NCBI under. This .sbt file can be generated by filling out the form here https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/template/submission/

2. Put the newly generated template.sbt file onto your computer. (Generally it's easiest to just put it in the ClinVirusSeq folder) If you'll be submitting multiple sequences from different people you can generate more than one, put them all in this folder, and choose which one you want to use at run time. 

3. (Optional)
You can generate a .csv file with most metadata that you wish to associate with your sequences. The file should have across the top Strain (the name of the fasta sequences that you'll import) followed by columns with NCBI approved metadata https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/modifiers.html

An example metadata file has been provided under the name example_metadata.csv 

If you don't have very many sequences at a time or you include a fasta not in your metadata sheet the program will automatically prompt you for strain name, collection date, country of collection and coverage (for ngs reads) you must fill out strain name, collection date and location or NCBI will not accept your submission, coverage is not necessary and if skipped during the automatic prompting will not create any issues 
# Usage - ClinVirusSeq.py
Create your fasta file with all of the sequences that you would like to annotate - you should make the names of the sequences (the things after > like >Strain_1 - this sequences name would be Strain_1) what you would like the strain of the virus (In your NCBI Genbank records) to be. 

Then you would need to run the ClinVirusSeq.py script from the command line. i.e. cd to the directory that this is living it - if you cloned from github it'll be ClinVirusSeq/ 

`python ClinVirusSeq.py -h` prints out a list of arguments and some help information

Normal usage will be `python ClinVirusSeq.py fasta_file_path author_template_path -metadata_loc metadata_info_path`

The last argument is optional and if you don't provide a metadata location the program will prompt you for it.

You can just put relative paths to your sbt and fasta file, I find it is easiest to store everything in the ClinvVirusSeq folder - that way you don't have to worry about typing paths. 

I would also reccomend not putting whitespace or escape characters in your strain names.

The program will run for a bit and generate a folder for each sequence in your fasta file. The folder will be named the same as you named the strain in the fasta file. (so if the first line of your fasta file is >SC12309 then there will be a folder called SC12309 with all of the .gbf .tbl and ect files that you need and love) 

Inside each folder will be some files, the .sqn file is what you email to gb-sub@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and then shortly after your sequences will be deposited on NCBI. 

tbl2asn will also spit out some errors and warnings onto the command line which are obviously pretty helpful. 

The program itself will also examine each sequence record for stop codons and notify you of which ones contain stops.

# Implementation Details and Important Notes

Right now we accomplish the annotation by searching blast for the best hit that is a complete genome and using a maaft alignment to generate annotations for the supplied sequence. Basing the annotations off the best blast hit. We can handle some ribosomal slippage as well as RNA editing in all human viruses Coronavirus 229E and HPIV3 are annotated off hardcoded records due to variability in accuracy for these records in blast. - Following this note - a large problem is actually inconsistent spelling in genbank sequence records or sequence records that do not have every protein annotated. I continually try to update this program to deal with problems that come up, but this is a major source of error right now.


# Future directions
Mainly just bugfixing and streamlining, paper writing in progress.
